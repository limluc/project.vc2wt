# Version Control 2 Work Tool (vc2wt)

This is Reconciliation Service for Project/Time Management Tool to Version Control Tool

This applied in big organisation when you work with multiple releases.

Example flow
* Work/Project Management Tool, such as JIRA is used.
* Some Work Items are raised in the JIRAs and tagged for a release
* At the end of the sprint cycle / development period, we'd like to check for commits in the repository, i.e. Git
